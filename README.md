simple blog / cms

- I have cover all the requirements excepts publishing on a server. 
- I found an hosting company bt the setup is not clear. 
- i focus on covering the requirements and didn't spend to much time with design and architecture

Ideas:
- there is the possibility to use marionettejs that is on top of backbone and provide powerful element and aoid redundant words
- Instead of handelbars, i ould use for production hbs, that much handy than handelbars.
- Of course the separation in between model and view should be done in the backbone part of the app.

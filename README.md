simple blog / cms

- I have cover all the requirements excepts publishing on a server. 
- I found an hosting company, but the setup was not clear. 
- i focused on covering the requirements and didn't spend to much time with design and architectur

Ideas:
- there is the possibility to use marionettejs, that is on top of backbone and provide powerful element and avoid redundant work
- Instead of handelbars, i would use for production hbs, that is much handy than handelbars.
- Of course the separation in between model and view should be done in the backbone part of the app.
